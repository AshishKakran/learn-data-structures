#Common applications of stack

1. Last In First Out operations or reversal
    - These are the applications where you have to go to the end of the structure first and then operate backwards
    - reverse a sequence, decimal to binary conversion
2. Parsing
    - When you have to memoize and hold on to some token until you find matching token to parse out the content
    - e.g expression validation
3. Postponement
    - you postpone any operation until you have seen the end of the data
    - e.g infix to postfix transformation
4. Backtracking
    - Where you have to exhaust possible ways of going to the target 
    - e.g  Queens problem, Mouse in a maze
